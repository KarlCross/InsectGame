------
  I suggest we focus for now on a simplified game which consists of:
  
  1. menu (full screen with play button)
  2. single game map
  3. single building (ant hill)
  4. single unit type (red ant infantry)
  5. non projectile combat
  
  I'll upload a suggested class diagram shortly.
