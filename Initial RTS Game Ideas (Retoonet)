Units



Offense Ground Units


  Red Ants (Weaker by themselves, cheaper)
  
  Dung Beetles (Rolls dung over units)

  Spiders (Perhaps quite a bit stronger, but more expensive)

Workers


  Worker Ants (A little slower, much cheaper than bees)

  Bee Drones (Fast, but expensive (Perhaps can make extra things?))

Air Attack


  Flies (Cheap, frail)
  
  Locusts? (Capable of destroying buildings quickly?)

  Wasps (More expensive, stronger)
  
  Basic Moths? (Can't think of method of attacking currently, but perhaps it can defend itself with sonar)
  
  Atlas Moths? (Much larger and stronger than basic moths, much more expensive)

Defenses


  Artillery Beetles (Long range, less accurate than worms, slower, but very strong)

  Worms (Shorter range than beetles, a lot more accurate, and faster)

Specialised Units (More expensive perhaps?)


  Dragonfly (Very fast, flies)

  Scorpion (Large, poisons things it attacks?)

  Grasshopper (Can leap over long distances)

  Centipede (Can carry other units)

  Leaf Insects/Stick Insects (Can camoflage)
  
  
Should there be extinct insects?


Buildings


  Queen Ant (Start off with this, can create worker ants)

  Queen Bee (Creates the different types of bees)
  
  Hive? (Used to produce honey (Bees can speed production up?))
